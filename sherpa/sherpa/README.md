# Sherpa

Hello Sherpa Team! Thank you for the opportunity to get to know each other during this interview process. 
Although I am new to angular, I was happy to learn a few things and work on this coding challenge for you. 

What I am happy about:

* the repsonsive layout
* the use of the observable and behaviour subject patterns in relation to the streamed and observable data

What I am unhappy about:
* never made it to the tests
* do not understand how to refresh the subscribed list between 2 separate components where list is not a global one

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.2.0.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference](https://angular.io/cli) page.
